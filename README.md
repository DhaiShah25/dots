# Dotfiles

These are my dotfiles for a hyprland setup on nixOS. I have based some of the nixOS configuration from the following [gist](https://gist.github.com/0atman/1a5133b842f929ba4c1e195ee67599d5#file-nixos-rebuild-sh-L10)

The desktop consists of the following:

- waybar
- hyprland
- rofi-wayland
- hyprpaper
- hyprlock
